# [Project 1 :Diabetes Analysis](https://github.com/fklaggesd/portfolio/blob/main/Project_Diabetes_Analysis.ipynb)
# Context
Diabetes is one of the most frequent diseases worldwide and the number of diabetic patients are growing over the years. The main cause of diabetes remains unknown, yet scientists believe that both genetic factors and environmental lifestyle play a major role in diabetes.

A few years ago research was done on a tribe in America which is called the Pima tribe (also known as the Pima Indians). In this tribe, it was found that women are prone to diabetes very early. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients were females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

# Objective
- Aanalyze different aspects of Diabetes in the Pima Indians tribe by doing Exploratory Data Analysis.

Also, you have to use this information to predict if an employee is at risk of attrition. This information will be used to target them with incentives.

- Identify the different factors that drive attrition
- Make a predictive model of if an employee will attrite or not

# [Project 4: Poor countries Grow Faster?](https://github.com/fklaggesd/Portfolio_FKD/blob/main/Poor_Countries_Grow_Faster.ipynb)

# Context

The Barro Lee data consists of a panel of 138 countries for the period 1960 to 1985. The dependent variable is national growth rates in GDP per capita for the periods 1965-1975 and 1975-1985. The growth rate in GDP over a period from t1 to t2 is commonly defined as log(GDPt1 /GDPt2 ). The number of variables are p=62. The number of complete observations is n=90.

The full data set and further details can be found at http://www.nber.org/pub/barro.lee, http: //www.barrolee.com, and, http://www.bristol.ac.uk//Depts//Economics//Growth//barlee.htm.

# Objective
