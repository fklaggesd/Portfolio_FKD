The Barro Lee data consists of a panel of 138 countries for the period 1960 to 1985. The dependent variable is national growth rates in GDP per capita for the periods 1965-1975 and 1975-1985. The growth rate in GDP over a period from t1 to t2 is commonly defined as log(GDPt1 /GDPt2 ). The number of variables are p=62. The number of complete observations is n=90.

The full data set and further details can be found at http://www.nber.org/pub/barro.lee, http: //www.barrolee.com, and, http://www.bristol.ac.uk//Depts//Economics//Growth//barlee.htm.
